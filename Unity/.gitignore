### Unity Archetype Rules

# Ignore NuGet Package folders
**/[Pp]ackages/*/**
# NuGet packages are automatically restored, making it unnecessary to
# keep them under version control. The Packages folder itself cannot
# be ignored, however, because Unity adds a manifest.json file for
# the Unity Package Manager inside of the folder.

# Don't ignore any Unity Plugin files
!**/[Aa]ssets/Plugins/**
# While the contents of the Plugin folder aren't ignored anyway, some
# plugins might contain files with extensions that are. To ensure
# such plugins don't break because of missing files, it's better to
# be safe and just keep all of their files in the repository.

# Don't ignore Asset meta data in subfolders of this folder
!**/[Aa]ssets/**/*.meta
# The gitignore.io rule for un-ignoring Asset meta data only applies
# if the .gitignore file is in the root directory of the Unity
# project. Since this is not the case for us (we have a "global"
# .gitignore file for all Unity projects in the repository), this
# additional rule is needed.

# Ignore JetBrains' Unity Plugin
**/[Aa]ssets/Plugins/Editor/JetBrains.meta
**/[Aa]ssets/Plugins/Editor/JetBrains/**
# Since the plugin is automatically installed when opening a Unity
# project with a JetBrains IDE, it can be safely ignored.
